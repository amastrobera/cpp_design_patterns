### Design Patterns with c++ ###

This repo contains an example of (my favourite) patterns implemented in (my favourite language) c++.


To build everything, I required c++11 and cmake. So, the classic `mkdir build && cd build` and `cmake .. && make \-j4` is expected to build.

I try to give a spin to this repo by added some interesting c++11 features, such as scoped pointers, threads \& locks, new function pointers, variadic arguments. To achieve that I use the libraries: `functional`, `memory`, `thrad`, `mutex`.
